					>Following his parents' death in Africa, John Clayton has been be
					raised by an ape, was known by the name Tarzan, but eventually left
					Africa and for his parents' home in England, along with the woman he
					fell in love with and married, Jane Porter. He is asked by Belgian
					King Leopold to go to Africa to see what he has done there to help the
					country. Initially, he refuses. But an American, George Washington
					Williams, wants him to accept so he can accompany him. He says that
					Leopold might be committing all sorts of atrocities to achieve his
					goal, like slavery. Clayton agrees and his wife insists that she
					accompany him because she misses Africa. When they arrive, a man named
					Rom, who works for Leopold, attacks their village and captures Tarzan
					and Jane. With Washington's help he escapes and sets out to rescue
					Jane by going across the jungle. Washington joins him despite being
					told that he might not make it.</blockquote
